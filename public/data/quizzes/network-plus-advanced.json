    {
      "questionText": "A network administrator needs to implement a technology that will allow for dynamic IP address allocation while ensuring devices maintain the same IP address over time. Which DHCP feature should be implemented?",
      "options": [
        "DHCP Snooping",
        "DHCP Reservation",
        "DHCP Helper",
        "DHCP Relay"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "DHCP Reservation",
      "explanation": "DHCP Reservation allows administrators to assign consistent IP addresses to specific devices based on their MAC addresses, ensuring they receive the same IP addresses each time they renew their leases."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "Which routing protocol uses link-state advertisements and has an administrative distance of 110?",
      "options": [
        "RIP",
        "BGP",
        "EIGRP",
        "OSPF"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "OSPF",
      "explanation": "OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a link-state routing protocol with an administrative distance of 110. It uses link-state advertisements (LSAs) to build and maintain its topology database."

    {
      "questionText": "Which of the following cable types would be MOST appropriate for a connection between a building's main distribution frame (MDF) and an intermediate distribution frame (IDF) located 300 meters away?",
      "options": [
        "Cat6a UTP",
        "Single-mode fiber",
        "Coaxial",
        "Multi-mode fiber OM3"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Single-mode fiber",
      "explanation": "Single-mode fiber is designed for long-distance connections (up to many kilometers) and is the appropriate choice for a 300-meter run between an MDF and IDF. Cat6a has a maximum distance of 100 meters, multi-mode OM3 is limited to about 300 meters but with less future-proofing, and coaxial is not typically used for this application."

    {
      "questionText": "A technician is configuring a switch port for a VoIP phone with an attached workstation. Which of the following configurations would be MOST appropriate?",
      "options": [
        "Access port with a single VLAN",
        "Trunk port with native VLAN",
        "Access port with voice VLAN",
        "Port channel with LACP"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Access port with voice VLAN",
      "explanation": "When configuring a switch port for a VoIP phone with an attached workstation, an access port with voice VLAN is most appropriate. This configuration places voice traffic on the voice VLAN and data traffic from the workstation on the access VLAN, allowing for QoS prioritization of voice traffic."
    },
    {

The other options may restrict access but don't encrypt the actual data in transit."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "A network engineer is designing a disaster recovery solution and needs to establish an alternate site with equipment ready to be configured in case of emergency. Which type of disaster recovery site is being implemented?",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Warm site",
      "explanation": "A warm site is a disaster recovery location that has the necessary equipment in place but requires configuration before becoming operational. Hot sites are fully operational duplicates, cold sites provide only basic infrastructure without equipment, and mirror sites are continuously synchronized duplicates of the production environment."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "Which of the following WAN connectivity options provides dedicated point-to-point connectivity with guaranteed bandwidth?",
      "options": [

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Port security",
      "explanation": "Port security allows administrators to restrict which and how many MAC addresses can communicate through a switch port, preventing MAC address spoofing attacks by limiting authorized MAC addresses per port and taking action when violations occur."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "Which network troubleshooting command provides information about the route packets take to reach a destination, including latency at each hop?",
      "options": [
        "ping",
        "nslookup",
        "ipconfig",
        "tracert/traceroute"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "tracert/traceroute",
      "explanation": "Tracert (Windows) or traceroute (Linux/Unix) shows the path packets take to reach a destination and the latency at each hop along the route, helping identify where delays or failures occur in the network path."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "What is the difference between Implicit Deny and Explicit Deny in firewall configurations?",
      "options": [
        "Implicit Deny requires a specific rule; Explicit Deny is automatically applied",
        "Implicit Deny logs blocked traffic; Explicit Deny does not log anything",
        "Explicit Deny is a written rule; Implicit Deny exists by default without being written",
        "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Explicit Deny is a written rule; Implicit Deny exists by default without being written",
      "explanation": "Explicit Deny refers to a rule specifically written to deny certain traffic, while Implicit Deny is the default behavior at the end of an access control list where anything not explicitly permitted is denied without requiring a written rule."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "An organization needs to implement a wireless network supporting both legacy devices and new high-performance clients. Which of the following would be the MOST appropriate configuration?",

      "correctAnswer": "Dual-band network with WPA2/WPA3 transition mode",
      "explanation": "A dual-band network with WPA2/WPA3 transition mode provides compatibility for legacy devices on 2.4 GHz with WPA2 while allowing newer devices to connect via 5 GHz and WPA3, offering the best balance of performance, compatibility, and security."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "Which network monitoring protocol uses UDP port 161 for polling and can retrieve information from network devices using OIDs?",
      "options": [
        "SNMP",

      "options": [
        "Protocol analyzer",
        "Tone generator",
        "Heat map generator",
        "Cable certifier"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Heat map generator",
      "explanation": "A heat map generator is the most useful tool for determining optimal access point placement as it provides a visual representation of wireless signal coverage, helping identify areas with strong and weak signals throughout the facility."

        "SYN flood",
        "DNS cache poisoning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "SYN flood",
      "explanation": "A SYN flood attack works by sending numerous SYN packets but never completing the TCP three-way handshake, causing the firewall to maintain half-open connections until its state table fills up, potentially preventing legitimate connections."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "Which of the following is NOT typically a responsibility of the data plane in a software-defined network (SDN)?",

        "Packet forwarding",
        "Determining routing paths",
        "Traffic filtering",
        "QoS enforcement"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Determining routing paths",
      "explanation": "Determining routing paths is a function of the control plane in SDN, not the data plane. The data plane is responsible for actual packet forwarding, traffic filtering, and QoS enforcement based on instructions from the control plane."
