    {
      "questionText": "What is the subnet mask in dotted decimal notation for a /27 prefix?",
      "options": [
        "255.255.255.0",
        "255.255.255.128",
        "255.255.255.192",
        "255.255.255.224"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "255.255.255.224",
      "explanation": "A /27 prefix has 27 network bits and 5 host bits. The subnet mask is calculated as 255.255.255.224 (11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000 in binary)."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "How many usable host addresses are available in a /29 subnet?",
      "options": [
        "2",
        "6",
        "8",
        "14"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "6",
      "explanation": "A /29 prefix has 3 host bits (32-29=3). The formula for calculating usable hosts is 2^host bits - 2, so 2^3 - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6 usable host addresses."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "Which of the following is the broadcast address for the subnet 192.168.10.64/26?",
      "options": [
        "192.168.10.64",

        "192.168.10.255"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "192.168.10.127",
      "explanation": "A /26 network has a subnet mask of 255.255.255.192. The network address is 192.168.10.64, and with 6 host bits, the broadcast address is 192.168.10.127 (network address + 2^host bits - 1)."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "What is the CIDR notation for a subnet mask of 255.255.254.0?",

      "correctAnswer": "/23",
      "explanation": "The subnet mask 255.255.254.0 in binary is 11111111.11111111.11111110.00000000, which has 23 network bits. Therefore, the CIDR notation is /23."

    {
      "questionText": "A company needs to divide a /24 network into 6 equal subnets. What is the appropriate subnet mask for this scenario?",
      "options": [
        "/25",
        "/26",
        "/27",
        "/28"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "/27",
      "explanation": "To create at least 6 subnets from a /24 network, you need at least 3 subnet bits (2^3 = 8 subnets). Adding 3 bits to /24 gives you /27 (255.255.255.224)."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "What is the network address for the host 172.16.45.173/20?",

        "172.16.32.0",
        "172.16.45.0",
        "172.16.32.173"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "172.16.32.0",
      "explanation": "A /20 network has a subnet mask of 255.255.240.0. When applied to 172.16.45.173, the network address is 172.16.32.0."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "What is the purpose of VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking)?",
      "options": [
        "To create subnets of different sizes from a single address space",
        "To increase the security of IP addressing",
        "To convert IPv4 addresses to IPv6 addresses",
        "To provide automatic IP assignment to network devices"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "To create subnets of different sizes from a single address space",
      "explanation": "VLSM allows network administrators to create subnets of different sizes from a single address space, optimizing address allocation based on actual host requirements."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "Which IP address represents a valid host IP in the subnet 192.168.15.192/28?",
      "options": [
        "192.168.15.191",
        "192.168.15.192",
        "192.168.15.193",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "192.168.15.193",
      "explanation": "For the subnet 192.168.15.192/28, the network address is 192.168.15.192 and the broadcast address is 192.168.15.207. A valid host IP must fall between these two addresses, making 192.168.15.193 the only valid option listed."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "What does the 'magic number' represent when using magic number subnetting?",
      "options": [
        "The number of available host addresses",
        "The CIDR prefix length",
        "The interval between subnets in an octet",
        "The default gateway address"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "The interval between subnets in an octet",
      "explanation": "The magic number is the interval value between subnet ranges, calculated as 256 minus the subnet mask's interesting octet. It helps to quickly identify subnet boundaries."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "How many total addresses (including network and broadcast addresses) are in a /29 subnet?",
      "options": [
        "4",
        "6",
        "8",
        "16"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "8",
      "explanation": "A /29 subnet has 3 host bits (32-29=3). The total number of addresses is 2^host bits, so 2^3 = 8 total addresses, which includes the network and broadcast addresses."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "If a network requires 500 host addresses, what is the minimum subnet mask that can accommodate this requirement?",
      "options": [
        "/22",
        "/23",
        "/24",
        "/25"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "/23",
      "explanation": "For 500 host addresses, you need at least 9 host bits (2^9 = 512), which means a /23 subnet mask (32-9=23) is the minimum required to accommodate these hosts."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "What is the first usable host address in the subnet 10.0.0.0/22?",

      "correctAnswer": "10.0.0.1",
      "explanation": "For the subnet 10.0.0.0/22, the network address is 10.0.0.0. The first usable host address is always the network address + 1, which is 10.0.0.1."
