  "questions": [
    {
      "questionText": "What is the primary purpose of a VLAN?",
      "options": [
        "To create separate broadcast domains within a single physical network",
        "To increase network speed",
        "To provide wireless connectivity",
        "To replace routers"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "To create separate broadcast domains within a single physical network",
      "explanation": "VLANs create logical broadcast domains within a single physical network, allowing for better network segmentation and security."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "True or False: VLANs can span across multiple switches.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "True",
      "explanation": "VLANs can span across multiple switches using trunk ports and VLAN tagging protocols like 802.1Q."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "Which protocol is commonly used for VLAN tagging?",
      "options": [
        "802.1Q",
        "802.11",
        "802.3",
        "802.5"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "802.1Q",
      "explanation": "802.1Q is the standard protocol used for VLAN tagging, which adds a 4-byte tag to Ethernet frames."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "A network administrator needs to configure a switch port to carry traffic for multiple VLANs. What type of port should they configure?",
      "options": [
        "Trunk port",
        "Access port",
        "Native port",
        "Management port"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Trunk port",
      "explanation": "Trunk ports are configured to carry traffic for multiple VLANs between switches."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "True or False: VLANs provide complete security isolation between different departments.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "False",
      "explanation": "While VLANs provide logical separation, additional security measures like firewalls and access control lists are needed for complete security isolation."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "What is the default VLAN number on most switches?",
      "options": [
        "VLAN 1",
        "VLAN 0",
        "VLAN 100",
        "VLAN 4096"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "VLAN 1",
      "explanation": "VLAN 1 is the default VLAN on most switches and cannot be deleted."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "A company has three departments: Sales, Marketing, and IT. Each department needs its own network segment. How many VLANs should be created?",
      "options": [
        "3 VLANs",
        "2 VLANs",
        "4 VLANs",
        "1 VLAN"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "3 VLANs",
      "explanation": "Each department should have its own VLAN for proper network segmentation."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "True or False: VLANs can help reduce broadcast traffic on a network.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "True",
      "explanation": "VLANs create separate broadcast domains, which helps reduce broadcast traffic by limiting it to only the devices within the same VLAN."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "What is the maximum number of VLANs that can be created on a switch using 802.1Q?",
      "options": [
        "4096",
        "1024",
        "2048",
        "8192"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "4096",
      "explanation": "The 802.1Q standard allows for 4096 VLANs (0-4095), though VLAN 0 and 4095 are reserved."
    },
    {
      "questionText": "A network administrator notices that devices in different VLANs cannot communicate. What device is needed to enable communication between these VLANs?",
      "options": [
        "Router",
        "Switch",
        "Hub",
        "Bridge"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Switch",
      "explanation": "A router (or Layer 3 switch) is required to enable communication between different VLANs, as VLANs are separate broadcast domains."
